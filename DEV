Actually I really like the following API
http://library.gnome.org/devel/rhythmbox/unstable/RBPlayer.html

For the mockup, I recommend the following :
- The main playback on top of the screen stays with the main output. So, in
  "party mix", stopping is not possible and it follows the playlist.
- a kind of secondary player could appear on the bottom named "headphone" or
  something like this. When we are on the library page, double clicking on a
file start play back on the secondary output.
- the item "add to the playlist" keep the same behaviour.
- in the main playlist, double clicking on a file start playback on the
  secondary output.

Additional feature:
- already played musics could appear in gray. I use the "last played" column
  to know which files have been already played in the party.

Any other idea?

PS: I know well C++ but not so easy with python. I will easily follow when you
will have started.

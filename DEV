Actually I really like the following API
http://library.gnome.org/devel/rhythmbox/unstable/RBPlayer.html

For the mockup, I recommend the following :
- The main playback on top of the screen stays with the main output. So, in
  "party mix", stopping is not possible and it follows the playlist.
- a kind of secondary player could appear on the bottom named "headphone" or
  something like this. When we are on the library page, double clicking on a
file start play back on the secondary output.
- the item "add to the playlist" keep the same behaviour.
- in the main playlist, double clicking on a file start playback on the
  secondary output.

Additional feature:
- already played musics could appear in gray. I use the "last played" column
  to know which files have been already played in the party.

Any other idea?

PS: I know well C++ but not so easy with python. I will easily follow when you
will have started.

Working with Eclipse
====================
- Install
  - Eclipse >3.5
  - PyDev
  - EGit
- Import project using the following settings:
  - git@github.com:neskie/prehear.git
    (choose git+ssh as protocol, do not enter a password for the "git" login,
    and be sure github is aware of you ssh public key)
    
    
Getting sources with Git
1. Cloning the repository:
    git clone git@github.com:Stibbons/prehear.git
2. Add upstream repostory:
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/neskie/prehear.git
3. Merge change from upstream
    git merge upstream/master
4. Commit change to my repo
    git push origin master
    
    
Rappel:
- Origin/master   : branche "master" sur mon repo distant
- upstream/master : branche "master" sur le repo distant parent.
